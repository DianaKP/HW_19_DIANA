            <h1 id="leftalign">A Little About Me...</h1>
            <p>My name is Diana, I was born and raised in San Antonio, TX.  I love the Spurs, hiking, trips to the beach and hanging with my 2 cats, my dog and family!
            </p>

            <p>   I have a diverse background that includes a 13 year career working in the food & beverage/hospitality industry, over 5 of those years as a sales representative for the largest wine & spirits distributor in the US, where I became a level 1 Sommelier. 
            </p>
                
            <p>   I chose to enter into the UX/UI Design world because I enjoy the creativity it allows me, as well as continuing my passion for working with clients and helping people, and also bridging gaps to help stakeholders and consumers alike in the ever evolving digital world. 
            </p>    
            <p>Cheers!</p>

                <h2>User Research</h2>
                <p>User research is probably the most important thing that fuels a great solution.  Forming meaningful user interviews & questions, user testing and generating helpful resources like the affinity diagram and journey maps have been the backbone of each project I have completed.  This affinity diagram is an example from my first case study where I interviewed 5 people to learn about their experiences when planning a trip with a group of people when I was working to create a mobile app focused on travel and planning trips.  See how this diagram was utilized below in my Let'sGO Mobile App case study.

                <h2>User Empathy</h2>
                <p>My past experience in client-facing roles blended with my new experiences in UX design has allowed me to empathize with users/consumers to ultimately generate the best solution for them by always asking ‘Why’ and understanding their needs and concerns.  Here is an example of using I like, I wish, What if method  generated from user interviews to help generate the best features for the end user.   I followed up this step with a feature prioritization matrix.  See more on this by checking out my HANGRY Mobile App 
                case study below.

                <h2>Responsive Design</h2>
                <p>Although my experience in this area is new, I have really enjoyed creating UI designs that fit multiple devices and accessibilities.  This is something I hope to expand on further in my career.   Here I have an example from a government agency responsive redesign case study.  I focused on using UI elements like drop down menus and hover states, as well as improving site navigation and designing a more welcoming look. Checkout the full case study below.

            <p>The goal of this individual project was to create a travel themed mobile app with focus on onboarding.  I created a centralized travel planning app to help people plan a trip and collaborate with multiple people, to help the planner organize and communicate all travel plans with their group.  Let'sGO solved the problem of the, often times, stress-inducing task of trip planning.

            </h2>
            <p>The goal of this group project was to work together to create a mobile app that would enhance people’s lives.  We created a mobile app called Hangry, that would help people to choose what restaurant to go to when you can’t decide.  Aimed at helping couples or a couple of friends, when you both get a little "Hangry" and can't agree and want to make a quick decision without the drama.  This was a lot of fun!
